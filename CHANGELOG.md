## [1.0.2] – 2026-09-22

### Fixed

- `lixity dashboard` crashed with `NameError: name 'os' is not defined`
  (`os` was imported only in the `__main__` branch).
- `lixity dashboard` now accepts the documented `-o` shorthand for `--output`.

### Added

- Screenshots (CLI report, dashboard light/dark) generated from the reference
  manuscript, embedded in the README and the project page.
- `docs/USAGE.md`: full command-line, library and configuration reference with
  a metric glossary and troubleshooting section.
- `CHANGELOG.md`.
- CI matrix testing Python 3.10 and 3.12 plus a pinned lint step.
- `[project.urls]` metadata for repository, docs, changelog and issues.

### Changed

- README and GitHub Pages rewritten for readability, with a quick start, a
  dashboard guide and a worked example.
- Requires Python 3.10 or newer (previously `>= 3.9`, which was EOL and
  inconsistent with the configured Ruff target `py310`).
- Modernised type annotations (`X | None`, builtin generics), sorted imports,
  precise exception handling in `FileUtils`; all 99 Ruff findings resolved and
  the rule set pinned in `pyproject.toml`.

## [1.0.1] – 2026-09-22

### Changed

- English code comments, documentation and generated CLI/site text.

## [1.0.0] – 2026-09-22

### Added

- Initial release: corpus metrics (ASL, TTR, Guiraud R, Yule's K, Flesch, LIX,
  dialogue and function-word ratios, punctuation densities, perception
  filters), paragraph-accurate tense profiles, single-file HTML dashboard,
  seven language profiles plus a neutral fallback, and idempotent publication
  helpers.
